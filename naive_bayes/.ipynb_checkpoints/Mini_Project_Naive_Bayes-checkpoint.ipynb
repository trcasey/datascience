You'll also use a fundamental technique in Bayesian inference, called Naive Bayes. This mini-project is based on [Lab 10 of Harvard's CS109](https://github.com/cs109/2015lab10) class.  Please free to go to the original lab for additional exercises and solutions."

    "Let us define the vector derived from document d by $\\bar V(d)$. What does this mean? Each document is considered to be a vector made up from a vocabulary, where there is one axis for each term in the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "To define the vocabulary, we take a union of all words we have seen in all documents. We then just associate an array index with them. So \"hello\" may be at index 5 and \"world\" at index 99.\n",

    "Then, a set of documents becomes, in the usual `sklearn` style, a sparse matrix with rows being sparse arrays and columns \"being\" the features, ie the vocabulary. I put \"being\" in quites as the layout in memort is that of a matrix with many 0's, but, rather, we use the sparse representation we talked about above.\n",

    "Such a matrix is also catted a Term-Document Matrix. Here, the terms being indexed could be stemmed before indexing; for instance, jealous and jealousy after stemming are the same feature. One could also make use of other \"Natural Language Processing\" transformations in constructing the vocabulary. We could use Lemmatization, which reduces words to lemmas: work, working, worked would all reduce to work. We could remove \"stopwords\" from our vocabulary, such as common words like \"the\". We could look for particular parts of speech, such as adjectives. This is often done in Sentiment Analysis. And so on. It all deoends on our application.\n",

    "- You could try to build a NB model where the features are word pairs instead of words. This would be smart enough to realize that \"not good\" and \"so good\" mean very different things. This technique doesn't scale very well, since these features are much more sparse (and hence harder to detect repeatable patterns within).\n",
    "- You could try a model besides NB, that would allow for interactions between words -- for example, a Random Forest classifier.\n",
    "- You could consider adding supplemental features -- information about genre, director, cast, etc.\n",
    "- You could build a visualization that prints word reviews, and visually encodes each word with size or color to indicate how that word contributes to P(Fresh). For example, really bad words could show up as big and red, good words as big and green, common words as small and grey, etc."

In TF-IDF, we weigh this term frequency by the inverse of its popularity in all document. For example, if the word \"movie\" showed up in all the documents, it would not have much predictive value. By weighing its counts by 1 divides by its overall frequency, we down-weight it. We can then use this tfidf weighted features as inputs to any classifier."
