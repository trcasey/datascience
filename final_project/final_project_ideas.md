# Springboard Data Science Intensive Capstone Project Ideas

1. Denver Real Estate Price Predictor - My wife and I are seriously considering moving to Denver, Colorado within a year and have been looking at houses in the area on an almost daily basis. This project would use data from Trulia's API to explore how strongly factors such as number of bedrooms and age of the house affect the price of a house and then write a machine learning algorithm to predict what the final sale price will be. A similar option with an already existing dataset would use the Ames housing dataset: http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock/DataDocumentation.txt

2. Kaggle Competition: Airbnb New User Bookings - In this challenge, you are given a list of users along with their demographics, web session records, and some summary statistics. You are asked to predict which country a new user's first booking destination will be. All the users in this dataset are from the USA. https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings/data

3. Sentiment Analysis - I'm a big fan of reading books on my Amazon Kindle e-reader. Using data from Julian McAuley at UCSD, I would like to perform a sentiment analysis using reviews of books in the Kindle store.
